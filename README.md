# Convoy Shipping Company Efficiency Script

In this project I learned how to export data from an XLSX file to a CSV format, Cleaning the data entries in the CSV file, then pushing that data into an sqlite3 database and finally converting that Database Table into a JSON format and XML format. I now better understand how to prepare the data to populate an SQLite database using both Sqlite3 and SQLAlchemy. After completeing this project, I learned how scoring machines are built, and how to select which data should be exported to other systems (in JSON and XML formats).

# The Lore behind this project

You're employed at "Convoy", a family transport company. Things are not going well financially, so your bosses want you to create a database to manage the company's assets in a better way and introduce scoring machines to automate some work. You will be dealing with different file formats to export data to various systems.

# Showcase

Still to come. I have not fully finished everything. Still have to implement XML formatting and proper formatting.
